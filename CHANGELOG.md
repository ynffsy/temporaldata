## [0.1.3] - 2025-03-21
### Added
- Added `__iter__` method to `Interval` to iterate over the intervals. ([#36](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/36))

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where `Interval` unions fails when two intervals share the same start and end. ([#32](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/32))
- Fixed a bug where `Data.add_split_mask` does not propagate to nested `Data` objects. ([#32](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/32))
- Fixed a bug where `Interval.dilate` fails when the interval is empty. ([#35](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/35))

### Removed
- Removed `trials` as a special key that is not checked for data leakage. ([#32](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/32))

## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-22
### Added 
- Added documentation. ([#24](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/24), [#25](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/25), [#26](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/26))
- Added LISENCE file. ([#29](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/29))

### Changed
- Relaxed the requirements for `numpy`, `pandas`, and `h5py`. ([#27](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/27))

## [0.1.1] - 2024-11-11
### Added
- Added `set_train_domain`, `set_valid_domain`, and `set_test_domain` methods to `Data` to set the domain and split masks at once. ([#21](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/21))

### Changed
- Changed the `keys` method to `keys()` to be consistent with other packages. ([#22](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/22))

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where a `LazyData` object is instanitated, but the class does not exist, and `Data` should be used instead. ([#17](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/17))
- Fixed a bug where `is_dijoint` calls `sort` incorrectly causing an error when evaluating unsorted intervals. ([#20](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/20))

## [0.1.1] - 2024-06-17
### Added
- Added a `domain_start` attribute to the `RegularTimeSeries` object to simplify the creation of the domain. ([#8](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/8))
- Added an automated way of resolving `domain` for `Data` objects by infering it from
the domains of its attributes. ([#7](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/7))
- Added documentation. ([#6](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/6))
- Added special keys with the `_domain` suffix. These keys are exluded from `add_split_mask` and `_check_for_data_leakage`. ([#2](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/2))
- Added warning when `timestamps` or `start` and `end` are not in `np.float64` precision. ([#5](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/5))
- Added `materialize` method to lazy objects to load them directly to memory. ([#3](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/3))

### Changed
- Changed slicing behavior in the `RegularTimeSeries` to make it more consistent with the `IrregularTimeSeries` object. ([#4](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/4) [#12](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/12))
- Changed `repr` method of all objects to exclude split masks and `domain` attributes. ([#10](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/10))

### Deprecated
- Deprecated `trials` as a special key that is not checked for data leakage. ([#2](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/2))

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where `absolute_start` was not saved to hdf5 files. ([#9](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/temporaldata/pull/9))

## [0.1.0] - 2024-06-11
### Added
- Initial release of the package.
